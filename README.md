# Testing Practice in Js

This project is built to understand basic concepts of javascript testing techniques.

## Getting Started

### Installing

### Special Note on using ES6 import statements with Jest

The current version of Jest as it is does not recognize the import statement. In order for you to be able to use ES6 modules for this project you may do the following:

Install the @babel/preset-env package
npm i -D @babel/preset-env

Create a .babelrc file in the projectâ€™s root with the following lines of code:
{ "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"] }

### Install eslint for better linting in the project

Install eslint with running the following command
```
npm install eslint --save-dev
```
### Install jest 

```
npm install --save-dev jest
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests go ahead and run: 
```
npm run jest
```
